# remotio with extensions to non gpiozero devices
A remoteio device needs the remote server, where the device is situated, further an ident to identify it on the server for actions.
Last not least the obj_type of the device is needed to work with the right gpiozero device.
The client transfers the following parameter to the server to work with a gpiozero device:
  ident,obj_type,*args,**kwargs
While ident and obj_type are needed by remoteio the parameter *args and **kwargs are directly delegated to the gpiozero device

1. creating a gpiozero device
   rs=RemoteServer(ip_adress,port)
   led=Remote_XXX(rs,*args,**args), where xxx is the name of a gpiozero device like LED,PWMLED,RGBLED etc.
   The ident is automatically generated for the handling with the server, obj_type is just XXX

3. A command like blink(**kwargs) or on(*args) is to be used as described in the API of gpiozero.
   Further remoteio supports on(on_time) for a short impuls realized by blink(on_time=on_time,off_time=0,n=1).

4. remoteio supports a Remoteio_Compositum device, defined by having the attributes on,off,toggle,blink. It supports
  pulse for the gpiozero devices of the Compositum that can pulse. The functions getClientDevice(), setClientDevice() are used to make messages more readable by
  the user. At this purpose gpiozero offers **namedpins and *_order. Note that the devices used in Remote_Compositum may be situated on different server.

5. remoteio supports expressions like led.value=... by the use of properties.
   The attributes of a gpiozero device are reflected in the corresponding remoteio device. Remoteio differs between functions, attributes that are only readable and writeable attributes.
   The remoteio_client.py acts as a kernel for all devices, so that all remote devices are programmed in the same manner.

6. As extensions also non gpio zero devices may be used. But these classes must be wrapped in a form that they can be applied. As example Remote_W1Device in remote_extensions.py and
   W1Device in remote_wrapper.py are realized in order to read temperatures. Another Compositum is Remote_State in remote_extensions.py. For each remote device x the expression x.value
   reads the value of the device x on the server. Remote_State(x1,x2,...).value furnishes x1.value, x2.value,... These values are locally memorized in x1._value, x2._value, ...,
   i.e. the actual state of the device system.
   You can then take a decision how to change the system without provocating a high traffic between client and server. Remember, that the devices used here need not to be situated on the same server.
   

For details study the examples in controller.py
      

## Server (remote Raspberry Pi)
Use this all-in-one command to install remoteio as deamon on port `8509`.
The server can be updated with this command.
```
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/schech1/remoteio/raw/master/install.sh)"

```

##  Using pip
```
pip install remoteio
```
When you want to create the server by yourself, you can install the library via
pip and use the examples below, for server- and client usage.



## Server usage
Start a remote server on port `1234`.
If no port is specified default port `8509` will be used

```
from remoteio import run_server

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_server(port=1234)

```


## Client usage
```
from remoteio import RemoteServer

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server_ip = "192.168.1.38"
    server_port = 1234

    remote_server = RemoteServer(server_ip, server_port)
    remote_pin = Remote_LED(remote_server,pinNr)
    remote_pin.on(on_time=2.0) # (Optional) Time until switch off in sec
    remote_pin.blink() # Blink LED
    remote_pin.pulse() # Pulse LED
    remote_pin.off()
    remote_server.close()
# A complete set of examples is in controller.py
```

### Use Board numbering
```
pinNr = map_bg(7, 'b') # physical board number is translated to GPIO4
```
### Use GPIO numbering
```
pinNr = 4 # GPIO numbering (e.g. GPIO4) is default
```
